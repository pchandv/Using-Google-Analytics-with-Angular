 ## Using Google Analytics with Angular


## Getting Started

Clone the project repository by running the command below

`git clone https://github.com/Jordanirabor/Using-Google-Analytics-with-Angular`

## Setup

There isn't so much to do afterwards, the code is very simple and shows how to write the Angular `run` block so it sends data to Google Analytics whenever a transition to a new page is successfully completed.

Enjoy!
